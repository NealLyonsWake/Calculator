# Calculator

Welcome to my basic calculator app. It uses the four main mathmatical operators to calculate two numbers; operators and numbers are chosen by you.

This is another work through of using basic express methods (get and send) to produce a working server app.

This inital server is set on port 5000 (use "localhost:5000" to access the app).

Enjoy.
